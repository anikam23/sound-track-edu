# Peer-to-Peer Chat Implementation

## âœ… Complete Implementation

This document describes the peer-to-peer classroom chat feature that has been fully implemented.

### Architecture

**Models** (`Models/Chat/`):
- `ChatParticipant.swift` - Participant with id, displayName, colorHex
- `ChatTurn.swift` - Individual message/turn with timestamps
- `ChatSession.swift` - Complete chat session with roster and turns

**Services**:
- `ChatRoomService.swift` - MultipeerConnectivity for peer-to-peer messaging
- `ChatRecordingManager.swift` - Audio recording with live transcription
- `TranscriptStore.swift` - Extended to support both transcripts and chat sessions

**UI Components** (`UI/Chat/`):
- `ChatTabView.swift` - Main entry point
- `LobbyView.swift` - Role selection (Host/Participant)
- `RoomView.swift` - Chat room interface
- `ChatBubbleView.swift` - Message bubbles
- `RosterPillsView.swift` - Participant chips
- `HoldToSpeakButton.swift` - Press-and-hold recording button
- `SaveChatSheet.swift` - Save dialog
- `ChatViewModel.swift` - View model coordinating everything

### Key Features

**Room Management**:
- Host mode: Creates room with 4-character join code (e.g., "AB3X")
- Participant mode: Joins room with optional join code
- MultipeerConnectivity service type: "stedu-chat" (separate from teacher alerts)

**Hold-to-Speak**:
- Press and hold to record
- Drag up to lock for long turns
- Tap to unlock and stop
- Live partial transcription displayed
- Audio level visualization

**Message Broadcasting**:
- Records and transcribes locally on each device
- Broadcasts complete message to all peers
- Guaranteed correct attribution (no diarization needed)
- Messages appear on all connected devices

**Persistence**:
- Chat sessions saved to TranscriptStore with type `.chat`
- Review tab has segmented control: Transcripts | Chats
- Chat sessions displayed with participant info
- Tap to view read-only chat history

**Demo Mode**:
- Set environment variable `SHOW_DEMO=true` to enable
- Spawns fake messages for testing without multiple devices

### Testing

To test on multiple devices:

1. **Device 1 (Host)**:
   - Open Chat tab
   - Enter display name and select color
   - Tap "Start Room"
   - Note the join code

2. **Device 2 (Participant)**:
   - Open Chat tab
   - Enter display name and select color
   - Tap "Join Room"
   - Enter join code
   - Tap "Join"

3. **Chat**:
   - Hold the button to speak
   - Release to send
   - Messages appear on both devices
   - Tap "Save" to persist the conversation

4. **Review**:
   - Open Review tab
   - Switch to "Chats" segment
   - Tap a saved chat to view

### Technical Notes

**MultipeerConnectivity**:
- Service type: `stedu-chat`
- Encryption: Required
- Transport: `.reliable` mode for guaranteed delivery
- Discovery info includes: role, joinCode, displayName, colorHex

**Audio & Transcription**:
- Reuses existing LiveTranscriber speech recognition setup
- Partial results shown during recording
- Final text sent after release
- Handles permission requests automatically

**State Management**:
- ChatViewModel as single source of truth
- ObservableObject pattern for UI updates
- Combine publishers for service bindings

- Bonjour services for MultipeerConnectivity (may need to be added)

**Info.plist Keys** (if not already present):
- `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`
- `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription`
- `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription`
- `NSBonjourServices`: `_stedu-chat._tcp`
